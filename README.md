# EDA_Project
Welcome to my Project on EDA

**Introduction:**

Google Play Store is a digital distribution service operated and developed by Google. It serves as the official app store for certified devices running on the Android operating system as well as ChromeOS.

Google Play has also served as a digital media store, offering games, music, books, movies, and television programs. Applications are available through Google Play either for free or at a cost.

**Problem Statement**

Consumers have power. The power to choose what products to buy and what companies to support. Without consumer demand, Business could not sell their products or services.

Hence a Deep Analysis is crucial to meet & forecast their demands

**Objective**

Provide solutions to business using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) approach


**Overview**

*What is EDA?*

* EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.

*Why we need EDA?*

* EDA help us look at data before making any assumptions. It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables.
* Data scientists can use exploratory analysis to ensure the results they produce are valid and applicable to any desired business outcomes and goals.

How to do EDA?

* In EDA we will follow below steps

  i) Knowing our data -> Understanding the dataset size and shape

  ii)  Understanding our variables -> Exploring each variable to know the distribution, how it categorized and so on

  iii) Data Wrangling -> This is the process of removing errors and combining complex data sets to make them more accessible and easier to analyze.

  iv) Data Vizualization -> This is the representation of data through use of common graphics, such as charts, plots. These visual displays of information communicate complex data relationships and data-driven insights in a way that is easy to understand.

  v) Solution - Providing solutions by investigating the data relationships and data-driven insights

*What data we have?*

* We have a dataset of Google Play store in which we have the details of App, Category, Rating, Reviews, Size, Installs, Price Type, Price, Content Rating, Genres, Last Updated, Current Version and Android Version.
